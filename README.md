# 🧰 Queuectl — A CLI-based background job queue system (Python)

A CLI-based background job queue system built with **SQLite persistence**, **multi-worker support**, **automatic retries with exponential backoff**, and a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**.

It's designed to be compact, readable, and production-like — a great example of how to build a reliable local job processing system using only Python's standard library.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Persistent job queue using SQLite  
✅ Multiple concurrent workers  
✅ Priority scheduling (1–10; lower = higher priority)  
✅ Automatic aging to prevent starvation  
✅ Exponential backoff for retries  
✅ Automatic Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for failed jobs  
✅ Configurable retry and backoff values  
✅ Sequential auto-generated unique job IDs (`job1`, `job2`, …)  
✅ Cross-platform: works on both Windows and Ubuntu  
✅ No external dependencies — pure Python standard library

## ⚙️ Installation

### 🟩 On Ubuntu / WSL

1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jaideepp15/queuectl.git
cd queuectl
```

2️⃣ Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3️⃣ Install in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

✅ Verify installation:

```bash
queuectl --help
```

### 🟦 On Windows

1️⃣ Clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Jaideepp15/queuectl.git
cd queuectl
```

2️⃣ (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3️⃣ Install in editable mode:

```powershell
pip install -e .
```

✅ Verify installation:

```powershell
queuectl --help
```

⚠️ If you see `'queuectl' is not recognized`, ensure your Python Scripts folder is in your PATH
(e.g., `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts`).

---

## 🧠 How the CLI Works

`queuectl` is exposed automatically as a console script via `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.scripts]
queuectl = "queuectl.main:main"
```

After installation (`pip install -e .` or `pipx install --editable .`), you can invoke it directly from any terminal:

```bash
queuectl enqueue '{"command":"echo hello"}'
```

## 🧩 Priority Scheduling & Aging

### 🔹 Priority

Each job can be assigned a priority from **1** to **10**:

* 1 = **Highest priority**

* 10 = **Lowest priority**

* Default = **5**

Jobs with a lower priority number run first.
If two jobs share the same priority, the earlier created_at job executes first.

### 🔹 Aging (Anti-Starvation)

To prevent starvation of low-priority jobs:

* Every minute a job remains pending, its priority improves (priority number decreases).

* It won’t drop below priority 1.

* Eventually, long-waiting jobs will bubble up and be executed.

Example:

| **Job Id** | **Initial Priority** | **Wait time(mins)** | **Aged Priority** |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| job1 | 9 | 3 | 6 |
| job2 | 5 | 2 | 3 |
| job3 | 2 | 1| 1 |

This ensures fair scheduling while honoring job importance.

## 🧩 Example Commands

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Enqueue job | `queuectl enqueue '{"command":"echo Hello World"}'` |
| Check status | `queuectl status` |
| List jobs | `queuectl list --state pending` |
| View DLQ | `queuectl dlq list` |
| Retry DLQ job | `queuectl dlq retry job1` |
| Set config values | `queuectl config set backoff_base 2` |
| Clear all jobs | `queuectl reset` |

## ⚙️ Running Workers

Workers are long-running processes that continuously poll and execute jobs from the queue.

### 🧩 On Linux / Ubuntu / WSL

#### ▶ Option 1 — Foreground Workers (Interactive)
```bash
queuectl worker start --count 3
```

Example output:

```
[worker 0] pid=1102 started
[worker 0] picked job job1: echo hello
hello
[worker 0] job job1 completed
[worker 1] pid=1103 started
[worker 2] pid=1105 started
```

Keep this terminal open — workers will continue polling for jobs.

Open a second terminal to enqueue and inspect jobs:

```bash
queuectl enqueue '{"command":"echo another job"}'
queuectl status
```

#### ▶ Option 2 — Background (Daemon) Workers

Run workers as background services:

```bash
queuectl worker start --count 3 --daemon
```

Example output:

```
Started worker pid=1234
Started worker pid=1235
Started worker pid=1236
Saved PIDs to ~/.queuectl/pids.json
```

Stop workers gracefully:

```bash
queuectl worker stop
```

### 🟦 On Windows

```powershell
queuectl worker start --count 3
```

Example output:

```
[worker 0] pid=5012 started
[worker 0] picked job job1: echo hello
hello
[worker 0] job job1 completed
[worker 1] pid=5013 started
[worker 2] pid=5015 started
```

Keep this terminal open for active workers.
Open another terminal for management commands:

```powershell
queuectl enqueue '{"command":"echo another job"}'
queuectl status
```

## 🧠 Architecture Summary

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Persistence | SQLite DB at `~/.queuectl/jobs.db` |
| Workers | Poll DB, claim pending jobs atomically |
| Priority | Lower numeric priority executes first |
| Aging | Pending jobs automatically gain higher priority over time |
| Concurrency | Managed via SQLite transactions (no race conditions) |
| Retry | Failed jobs rescheduled with exponential backoff |
| DLQ | Jobs exceeding max_retries moved to dead state |
| Job IDs | Auto-generated sequentially (job1, job2, job3...) |
| Config | Stored in config table (backoff base, retries) |
| Storage | Fully persistent between restarts |

---

## ⚙️ System Notes

✅ Works seamlessly on Linux and Windows  
✅ Auto-creates SQLite DB on first run  
✅ Background workers tracked via PID file  
✅ Thread-safe and crash-safe using SQLite WAL mode  
✅ Exponential retry logic: delay = base ^ attempts  
✅ Priority + Aging ensure fairness and responsiveness

## 🧱 Tradeoffs & Future Improvements

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Scope | Single-machine queue using SQLite |
| Scaling | For distributed queues, replace DB with PostgreSQL or Redis |
| Polling | Could be improved with event-driven triggers |
| Background mode | PID files work locally; use systemd/supervisor for production |
| Extensions | Could add job dependencies, scheduling, or a web dashboard |
